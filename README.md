I really enjoyed the book [*Seven Languages in Seven Weeks*](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) by Bruce Tate, in which you're treated to a whirlwind tour of Clojure, Haskell, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang and Ruby, learning just enough about each language to get a flavor and build something small with it.

I just found out that [*Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks*](https://pragprog.com/book/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks) is a thing, so here we go again! This time I'm going to keep track as I go through the book by keeping my solutions to the problems at the end of each chapter here. I might even be diligent in reading one chapter per day! When I read *Seven Languages in Seven Days*, I tended to read several chapters at a time -- I still really enjoyed it, but I don't think reading "more than a day's worth" of a language gave me time to properly digest each day's worth of material. I'm thinking doing it one day at a time might be even more enjoyable.
